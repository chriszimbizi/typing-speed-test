# Typing Speed Test

This is a web application that allows users to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy. Users are presented with random paragraphs and are required to type them accurately within a specified time limit. The application calculates and displays metrics such as words per minute (WPM), accuracy percentage, and characters per minute (CPM) to track the user's performance.

## Features

- Random Paragraphs: The application generates random paragraphs for users to type, providing a diverse range of content to practice typing skills.
- Timer: A countdown timer is displayed to set a time limit for typing the paragraph. The timer starts as soon as the user begins typing.
- Accuracy Tracking: The application tracks the user's accuracy by comparing the typed characters with the expected characters in real-time and provides an accuracy percentage.
- WPM Calculation: The application calculates the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of characters typed and the time taken.
- CPM Calculation: The application calculates the user's typing speed in characters per minute (CPM) based on the number of characters typed and the time taken.
- Mistake Count: The application keeps track of the number of mistakes made by the user while typing and provides feedback on incorrect characters.
